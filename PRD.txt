sktopAlright 👌 let’s create a **final, detailed PRD** — a single document explaining everything in detail, from problem statement to features, design, tech stack, and roadmap. This way you can save/share it as the **blueprint** of your project.

# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Name (suggested):** *BrokerAdda* (working title)

## 1. **Problem Statement**

Property dealers/brokers in India currently manage inventory and share information through **WhatsApp groups, phone calls, and notebooks**.

---

## 2. **Proposed Solution**

A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed **for dealers only**, not customers.

* Works on any smartphone, installable like an app, with simple UI.
